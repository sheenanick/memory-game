## Description

This is a web application game based on the card game Memory. All cards start face down. Each time the user takes a turn they click on 2 cards. When a card is clicked it reveals its picture. If the user gets a pair of cards with the same picture, the cards remain face up. If the user's selected cards are different they return to face down. When all the cards are face up, the user has won. The object of the game is to find all the pairs in as few turns as possible.
